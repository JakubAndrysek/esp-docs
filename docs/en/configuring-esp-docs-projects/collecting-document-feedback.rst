Collecting Document Feedback
=============================

To better gather user feedback, we can use a quicker and easier feedback channel by clicking thumbs up or down, and the number of likes and dislikes will be collected using Google Analytics.

.. note::

    `Espressif Documentation Feedback Form` is the link to the classic feedback form.


How to Add the Feedback Section to Your Repo
--------------------------------------------

Currently, there is a `_templates` folder under both the `en` and `zh_CN` directories in the documentation repository. Each folder contains a `layout.html` file that stores the feedback section for this documentation repository. Replace the content of this `layout.html` with the corresponding language's `layout.html` from the `../../feedback_templates` directory.

You need to replace `YOUR_DOCID` in the official website links (lines 53 and 60) with the corresponding docId for the document. Please note that the docIds for English and Chinese documents are different.

After that, you can compile the documentation, then the feedback section with thumbs up and down will appear.


Configuration of Collection of User Reactions in Google Analytics
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We need to add custom events to Google Analytics (GA4) to enable tracking of users feedback on documentation in the form of thumbs up/down.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1. The site with documentation to track reactions should be added to Google Analytics, see ESP-Docs > Configuring ESP-Docs Projects Â» `Collecting User Analytics <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-docs/en/latest/configuring-esp-docs-projects/collecting-user-analytics.html>`_.

    2. The Google Analytics should collect data from the site.

    3. The site should include the feedback section that shows thumbs up/down buttons (previous step).

    4. To configure the collection of user reactions in Google Analytics, you need to have access to the Google Analytics account that is used for the site with documentation.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration of the collection of user reactions in Google Analytics consists of the following steps:

- **Check if Custom Events are Sent to Google Analytics**

    1. Open the site with documentation in a browser and click the thumbs up/down buttons on a couple of pages.

    2. Open the Google Analytics account that is used for the site with documentation. Go to Reports > Realtime.

    3. On the dashboard find the `Event count by Event name` section and check if the events `user_reaction` are sent to Google Analytics. You may need to wait a couple of seconds for the events to appear. See the picture below.

            :align: center
            :scale: 45%
            :alt: Google Analytics realtime events page

    4. If the events are not sent to Google Analytics, check the code that sends the events to Google Analytics (previous step).

- **Add Custom Definition to Google Analytics**

    1. Open the Google Analytics account that is used for the site with documentation. Go to Admin > Property settings > Data display > Custom definitions.

    2. Click `Create custom dimension` and configure the custom dimension as follows:

        - Dimension name: `User Like Document`
        - Description: `User thumbs up/down reaction on documentation`
        - Scope: `Event`
        - User Property/Parameter: `user_likes_document`

    3. Click `Save` to save the custom dimension. See the picture below how the custom dimension should look like.

            :align: center
            :scale: 45%
            :alt: Google Analytics custom dimension page

- **Configure Exploration Report**

    1.  Go to Explore and click `Create a new exploration`. See the picture below.

        .. figure:: ../../_static/create-exploration.png
            :align: center
            :scale: 45%
            :alt: Google Analytics create exploration page

    2.  Configure the report's input `Variables`.
    
        Under `DIMENSIONS`, click `+`.  On the next page that will show up search and then select the following dimensions (see picture below). Click `Import` once both dimensions are selected.

        - Page Title
        - User Likes Document
        - Event Name

        .. figure:: ../../_static/exploration-add-dimensions.png
            :align: center
            :scale: 45%
            :alt: Google Analytics exploration add dimensions page

        Under `METRICS`, click `+`. On the next page that will show up search and then select the following metric. Click Import once the metric is selected.

        - Event count

    3.  Configure report by dragging and dropping previously added dimensions and metrics to the `Settings` panel.
    
        - Drop `Page Title` dimension to the `ROWS` section.
        - Drop `User Likes Document` dimension to the `COLUMNS` section.
        - Drop `Event count` metric to the `VALUES` section.
        - Drop `Event name` dimension to the `FILTERS` section.
        - Set the `Event name` filter to `exactly matches` the `user_reaction`.
        
        See the picture below. You may need to scroll down the `Settings` panel to see the `FILTERS` section.

        .. figure:: ../../_static/exploration-configure.png
            :align: center
            :scale: 45%
            :alt: Google Analytics exploration configuration

    4.  Fine tune the configuration:

        - Change the `EXPLORATION NAME` to `Show User Reactions`.
        - Select desired period to show the results.
        - Change `SHOW ROWS` to e.g. `100` to display more rows.

        The report would look like the picture below.

        .. figure:: ../../_static/exploration-report.png
            :align: center
            :scale: 45%
            :alt: Google Analytics exploration report

        .. note::

            The exploration reports do not show values for the current day. You need to wait at least 24 h from the first thumbs up/down clicked to see some values.
